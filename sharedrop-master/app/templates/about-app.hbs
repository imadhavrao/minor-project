  <h3>What is it?</h3>
  <p>
    ShareDrop is a free, <a href="https://github.com/szimek/sharedrop">open-source</a> web app that allows you to easily and securely share files directly between devices without uploading them to any server first.
  </p>

  <h3>How to use it?</h3>
  <h4>Sharing files between devices in a local network<sup>*</sup></h4>
  <p>
    To send a file to another device in the same local network, open this page (i.e. <a href="https://www.sharedrop.io">www.sharedrop.io</a>) on both devices. Drag and drop a file directly on another person's avatar or click the avatar and select the file you want to send. The file transfer will start once the recipient accepts the file.
  </p>

  <h4>Sharing files between devices in different networks</h4>
  <p>
    To send a file to another device in a different network, click <span class="plus-icon">+</span> button in the upper right corner of the page and follow further instructions.
  </p>

  <h4>VPNs</h4>
  <p>
    Sharedrop does not work with VPNs, please deactivate any VPN a device might be using.
  </p>

  <h3>Donate</h3>
  <p>ShareDrop is free, however, it still costs money to run. If you use it and like it, please consider making a small donation via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=99MJKQUTTQVYY&no_recurring=0&item_name=Help+cover+the+server+costs+for+sharedrop.io&currency_code=EUR">PayPal</a> to help me keep it free for everyone.</p>

  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>ShareDrop uses a secure and encrypted peer-to-peer connection to transfer information about the file (its name and size) and file data itself. This means that this data is never transfered through any intermediate server but directly between the sender and recipient devices. To achieve this, ShareDrop uses a technology called WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication), which is provided natively by browsers. You can read more about WebRTC security <a href="https://bloggeek.me/is-webrtc-safe/">here</a>.</p>
